### Types of Analysis / Plots and its meaning, its insights that I want to get :

1. Count (Magnitude of the number)
2. Percentage (Proportion)
3. Mean (Metric of Central Tendency)
4. Median (50%)
5. Box plot or Violin
6. Extratification
7. Dinamic Table
8. 

### IMPROVEMENTS for next time:

1. Create a Feature of MONTH, QUARTER and YEAR of Created Date and Closed Date - To make best analysis directly.
 - Analysis such as TM, â‚¬ / Month, 

2. How to let the charts more interactive for the public?
Try to create Interative charts on Streamlit (How can I do that? Is it necessary do not save the chart and instead build it on the streamlit?)
