        - WON Deals Close Faster Than LOST Deals
            - The average number of days to close a WON deal is significantly lower across all account types compared to LOST deals.
            - For example, Small Accounts take 34 days (WON) vs. 80 days (LOST) on average.

        -Top 2 Accounts Have the Fastest WON Deals
            - Among WON deals, Top 2 Accounts close the fastest, with a mean of 31.06 days, followed by Top 3 (34 days) and Small Accounts (34 days).
            - This suggests that Top 2 Accounts may have a more streamlined decision-making process or higher deal urgency.
        
        - Small LOST Accounts Take the Longest to Close:
            - Small Accounts have the highest average duration for LOST deals (80 days). This could indicate higher indecision or more budget constraints.
        
        - Higher Standard Deviation in LOST Deals Suggests Unpredictability, possibly due to prolonged negotiations or reconsiderations deals.

        - In LOST opportunities, New Business deals take an average of 104 days to close, whereas Existing Business deals take 58 days on average. This suggests that new business opportunities tend to remain open for longer before being lost, potentially indicating higher uncertainty, longer decision-making processes, or greater difficulty in conversion compared to existing clients.
        - Additionally, salespeople tend to receive a lost decision faster from existing business accounts than from new business accounts, making forecasts for existing business opportunities faster compared to new business.
